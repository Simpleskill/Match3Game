# Jewel Crush
Jewel Crush is a Match3 game created using C++ and the SDL2 library. In the game, players must swap adjacent jewels to create a row or column of three or more matching jewels.

When a match is made, the jewels disappear and new jewels fall from the top of the screen to fill the empty space. 

There is sound, music and particle effects included.
